# Drum-Kit
A Drum Kit Website

THe drum kit website is a learning curve for understanding how to modules in javaScript such as Eventlisteners to buttons and keystrokes to know when users are tapping of the keyboard and to response to it.

THe way this website works is that there a a couple of keys that represent a drums in a typical drum-set.
And when you click on any buttons or specific keys, then you will get the corresponding sound of the drum.
